Why do we do it?\n","\n"," In this exercise, the target variable is `Weight`, and to predict this column we have some variables: Species, Length1, Length2, Length3,\tHeight and Width. All this variables are continuos unless `Species`, that is categorical. So we want to transform this categorical variables into numbers.\n","\n"," In our case, we choose the 3 most common species and the ohter ones we collect in other variable. When we applied the dummies function, we will have 4 new columns: the 3 most common species and the others one. Each variable is converted in as many 0/1 variables as there are different values.\n","\n"," We do it because we can't train the model with categorical variables, for machine learning models require numerical input.\n","\n"," - Why is so important to divide our data into train and test datasets? Which is the purpose of doing it?\n","\n","  When we train some model, we don't usually validate with the same data that we trained. The main problem that we can find training and validating the model with the same data is overfitting the model (overfitting).\n","  This is because our model could be very focused in our data, and if we introduce other type of data may not be powerful in predicting future observations. Therefore, this observations are unknown, so the best option is to validate out model with outside observations. So the main porpose is to having better results in our model,  testing it with unknown data.\n","\n","  Usually, we divided our model into two datasets: train and test, with a proportion of 80% and 20% respectively.\n","\n"," - Why do we standardize some varaiables? Which type of variables do we standardize?\n","\n","  Usually, our data has been buildt for a particular problem statement and is built from various sources. It has different features, and each feature has different scales.\n","\n","  In order for our model to work well, it is very necessary for the data to have the same scale in terms of the Feature to avoid bias in the outcome.\n","\n","  The types of variables we standardize are the continuous variables centered in 0 and with a standard desviation 1.\n","\n","  First we standardize the training dataset, and then the test with the training paramentes.\n","\n","  We do not standardize the target variable."],"id":"bbbaee41"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"42f23018"},"source":["## Exercise 2\n","\n","Regarding the summary and the errors, Would you use this model to predict the weights of the fishes? Justify your answer. Comment the usefulness of the main indicators of the summary and the errors.\n","\n","Firstly, we have used the Ordinary Least Squares function from the statsmodels library, to print `OLS Regression Results`. In simple terms, it checks how much the actual data points differ from the line that represents the best prediction, helping us see how much error there is in our predictions.\n","\n","This table starts saying us which is our Dependant Variable that is Weight and, then the model OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) and the Date and Time we’ve created the Model. Then, it says the number of observations we have used to train this model (127). Otherwise, it says DF Residuals (degrees of freedom residuals), which is calculated:\n","\n","$ \\text{Df}_{\\text{Residuals}} = \\text{No}_{\\text{Observations}} - \\text{Df}_{\\text{Model}} - 1 $\n","\n","And then our model has a non robust covariance type. Talking about, the R-squared. R-squared (R²) tells us how much our model explains the differences in fish weights. An R² of 0.895 means our model accounts for a large part of these differences, which is good.\n","\n","Adjusted R-squared (Adj. R²) is like R-squared but adjusts for the number of things we're predicting. An Adj. R² of 0.889 means our model still works well even when considering multiple predictors.\n","\n","The F-statistic checks if our whole model is useful. A high F-statistic (144.5) with a tiny p-value (4.55e-55) means our model is very useful and better than no predictors.\n","\n","Coefficients show how each predictor affects fish weight. Length1, Length2, Bream, Others, and Perch have strong effects. However, Length3, Height, and Width might not matter much because their p-values are high.\n","\n","Now, let's look at the evaluation metrics for both the training and test datasets:\n","\n","**Training Metrics:**\n","\n","*   MAE (Mean Absolute Error): 79.48\n","*   MSE (Mean Squared Error): 11556.17\n","*   RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): 107.50\n","*   MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): Very close to zero\n","*   R² (R-squared): 0.895\n","\n","**Test Metrics:**\n","\n","*   MAE: 99.18\n","*   MSE: 26636.58\n","*   RMSE: 163.21\n","*   MAPE: 3.16\n","*   R²: 0.860\n","\n","Here's the analysis:\n","\n","The training R² is high (0.895), indicating that the model fits the training data well.\n","The test R² is also reasonably high (0.860), suggesting that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n","Both training and test MAE values are relatively low, indicating that the model's predictions are close to the actual weights on average.\n","The MAPE on both datasets is low, indicating low percentage errors in predictions.\n","\n","\n","Overall, this model appears to be a good predictor of fish weights, given the high R-squared values and low error metrics. However, it's essential to keep in mind that this assessment is based on the available data, and the model's performance should be monitored and validated with new data to ensure it continues to perform well in a real-world setting.
